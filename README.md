# PSD of Random Signals (GNU Radio)

This repository contains the implementation of Practice 2. The practice involved analyzing the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of random bipolar binary signals, audio and image-based signals, and examining effects of interpolation, bit unpacking, and white noise using GNU Radio. Results included PSD plots and parameter analyses, highlighting the importance of sampling rate and bit rate selection in signal processing.
