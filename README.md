# Modulation Analysis

This report analyzes several types of modulation: **OOK**, **BPSK**, and **FSK**, evaluating their behavior in the time and frequency domains. The constellations associated with each modulation technique and their variation when adjusting the carrier frequency and frequency deviation are studied. 

Through this analysis, the impact of these parameters on the performance of the modulations is evaluated, both in terms of **RF signals** and their representations in the **time**, **spectral**, and **complex envelope** domains.
