#Modulation M-QAM


In this practice we worked with M-QAM modulation using the GNURadio platform, with the objective of analyzing its behavior in different modulation orders. Schemes such as BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK and 16QAM were implemented by configuring constellation tables. Subsequently, the conversion to bandpass signals was performed by means of an up-converter, and their respective constellations, bit rates and frequency spectra were analyzed.
