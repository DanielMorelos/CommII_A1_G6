# Waveforming in Digital Modulation
The impact of raised cosine and root-to-raised cosine filters on 8-PSK and 16-QAM signal constellations was analyzed, evaluating how varying the parameter beta affects both the bandwidth and the power spectral density. Furthermore, the behavior of a 16-QAM modulated signal under different values ​​of beta is studied, considering the presence of noise, which allows observing its effect on the constellation quality.
