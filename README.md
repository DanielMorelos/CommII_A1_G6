# Modulation Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of Practice 3. The practice involved analyzing several types of modulation: **OOK**, **BPSK**, and **FSK**, evaluating their behavior in the time and frequency domains. The constellations associated with each modulation technique and their variation when adjusting the carrier frequency and frequency deviation were studied.

Through this analysis, the impact of these parameters on the performance of the modulations was evaluated, both in terms of **RF signals** and their representations in the **time**, **spectral**, and **complex envelope** domains.
