#  M-PSK 
In this practice, a digital communication system is implemented using M-Phase Shift Keying (M-PSK) modulation, which is a crucial technique in several communication applications, such as satellite data transmission, mobile telephony and fiber optic communications. GNU Radio is used for modulation implementation and signal analysis, including obtaining the complex envelope and constellation diagram analysis.
